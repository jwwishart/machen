Machen
======
Machen is a simple framework that works like presentation software i.e. PowerPoint. This project was developed as a tool for the revision of material Im learning in my study of Koine Greek. It allows simple creation of slides and the inclusion of sub panels that contain the answers. Slides are first shown with the answer hidden and the next time you press the spacebar or other relevant keys the answer section is shown. Movement is done through a variety of keyboard keys or mouse clicks and it has a full view port mode to remove everything bar the content area.

The current stable version is available here https://github.com/jwwishart/machen/tree/v0.3

This framework has had the presentation/slide functionality extracted out into a seperate jQuery plugin called jquery.machen.js
