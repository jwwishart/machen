A simple html based presentation (think PowerPoint) like framework that I hope to use as a revision tool.

A Html page will have a number of panels and clicking space will move you forward and backspace will move you backwards. Inside each panel can be an answer section. The answer section will show when you are on a panel and click the spacebar (as answer sections are hidden by default.) If the current panel's answer section is showing and the user clicks the space bar, then the next panel is shown.

I'm using this as a revision tool.
