BUGS:
- See if we can get rid of the data-panelid attribute and just use order of the panels.
- Provide full window mode (say press the f button and the top and the bottom borders dissappear
  N.B. hovering the mouse over the top right of the page might show the page no?
- IE 9 #Fail - Doesn't anchor to the bottom of the page, Page number doesn't show content etc.....
- Do viewport calculations on other window events... current situation doesn't work correctly when
  safari browser is min-maximized (chagned)

DONE:
- FIXED: Bottom bar doesn't sit nicely on page load in Chrome 10
- NOT A BUG: Backspace doesn't seem to work all the time? you sometimes have to press it twice? (Note: Panels didn't have the correct content, it just looked like this was happening)
