Features:
- Simple slide like mechanism fired by space, enter, arrows, backspace of mouse click
- F will hide the border and controlles etc. and just show the content.
- To setup just add div.machen-panel's in the content area (at that level, you cannot nest them.)
  and if you want answers put the div.machen-answer sections inside the machen-panel's and they
  will be shown. You can only put one answer panel inside a div.machen-panel (that suits my 
  purposes.)

TODO:
- Do viewport calculations on other window events... current situation doesn't work correctly when
  safari browser is min-maximized (chagned)
- TODO: a simple video for youtube? Using Machen itself as the presentation tool?
  
DONE:
- FIXED: Bottom bar doesn't sit nicely on page load in Chrome 10
- NOT A BUG: Backspace doesn't seem to work all the time? you sometimes have to press it twice? (Note: Panels didn't have the correct content, it just looked like this was happening)
